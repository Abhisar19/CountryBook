  <p class="t1">India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is the second-most populous
    country, the seventh-largest country by area, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian
    Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders
    with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the
    Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a
    maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.

  <p class="t1">
    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation,
    initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to
    Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus
    river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By
    1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest,
    unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of
    India were supplanted in the northern regions. By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within
    Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political
    consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their collective era
    was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and the incorporation
    of untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
    Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.
    <br>
    <br>
  <p class="t1">
    In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's southern and
    western coasts. Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains, eventually
    establishing the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. In
    the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India. In the
    Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries
    of relative peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture. Gradually expanding rule of the British East India
    Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty. British Crown rule
    began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and
    ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root. A pioneering and influential nationalist movement
    emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule. In 1947 the
    British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a
    Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.

    India has been a secular federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
    pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1,211
    million in 2011. During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and
    its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a
    fast-growing major economy, a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class. It has a
    space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and
    spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty,
    though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. India is a nuclear weapons state, which ranks high in military
    expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th
    century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition, and rising
    levels of air pollution. India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots. Its forest cover comprises
    21.4% of its area. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture, is
    supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.

      <font size="5">Etymology</font>
    </b></h3>
  <p class="t1">
    According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference
    to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India (
    Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and
    ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically the Indus river and, by implication, its
    well-settled southern basin. The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as "The
    people of the Indus".

    The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (About this soundlisten)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and
    the Constitution of India, is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical
    name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to a region of the Gangetic Valley, Bharat gained increased currency
    from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.

    Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (About this soundlisten)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal
    Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India
    and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.
